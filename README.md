<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>
Louis is an ongoing student project in order to develop an articulated robot arm with a task space in SE(3). Our goal is to learn general robotics and kinematics, with focus on experimenting rather than a good first result. Utilizing an iterative design approach we hope to learn enough in order to produce a small scale articulated robotic arm, with industry standards
