<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>
Louis is an ongoing student project in order to learn general robotics and kinematics. It is for learning and experimenting,
rather than a good first result. Utilizing an iterative design approach we hope to learn enough to produce a small scale robotic arm, with industry standards
